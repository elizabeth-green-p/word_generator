# Video Game Character Generator
## Codecademy Portfolio Project

To randomly generate statements from a set of options to build a video game character.
The structure is as follows:

>Your name is **[Name]**
>You are a **[video game race]** from the land of **[video game place]**
>As a **[video game class]** your preferred weapon is a **[weapon]** and your special skill is **[skill]**
>This is the beginning of your grand quest to defeat **[enemy group]** and thwart **[villain]**'s plans to conquer the world.
>Good luck!

I will be utilising **Math.random** and **Math.floor** to generate random numbers which point to the index of elements in larger arrays containing options which will be subsituted in to their relavant places and printed to the user.
