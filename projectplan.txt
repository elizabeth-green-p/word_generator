Video game character generator

Your name is []
You are a [video game race] from the land of [video game place]
As a [video game class] your preferred weapon is a [weapon] and your special skill is [skill]
This is the beginning of your grand quest to defeat [enemy group] and thwart [villain]'s plans to conquer the world.
Good luck!

make arrays containing strings for each [section] with multiple elements
use math.floor(math.random*(element amount)) to select a sequence of random numbers the amount equalling how many sections [8] there are and log numbers to array
use array to point to elements in each big array and save generated answers to an array
return sentences with generated answers in their place to the user

Potential Ideas:
Create a webpage to display the generator with the press of a button
Store the arrays in an interesting way *nested array or separate files to declutter the main program*
